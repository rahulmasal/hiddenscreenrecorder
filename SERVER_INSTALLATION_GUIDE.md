## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

#### Problem: "docker: command not found"

**Solution:**

- Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running
- Restart your computer after installing Docker
- Check if Docker Desktop is running in your system tray

#### Problem: "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"

**Solution:**

- Open Docker Desktop and wait for it to start
- Check if Docker Desktop shows "Docker Desktop is running"

#### Problem: Port 5000 already in use

**Solution:**

- Stop any existing server: `docker-compose down`
- Or change the port in `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., change "5000:5000" to "5001:5000")
- Then access via http://localhost:5001/admin

#### Problem: Container keeps restarting

**Solution:**

- Check logs: `docker-compose logs -f server`
- Make sure `.env` file exists and has correct values
- Check if volumes have correct permissions

### Manual Installation Issues

#### Problem: "Python is not recognized"

**Solution:**

- Restart your computer
- If still not working, reinstall Python and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"

#### Problem: "Access denied" when running install script

**Solution:**

- Make sure you right-click and select "Run as administrator"
- If still not working, temporarily disable antivirus

#### Problem: Server won't start

**Solution:**

- Check if port 5000 is already in use
- Open Command Prompt as Administrator and run:
  
```batch
  netstat -ano | findstr :5000
  ```

- If you see a process using port 5000, stop it or change the port in `.env` file

#### Problem: Can't access admin dashboard

**Solution:**

- Make sure the server is running: `sc query ScreenRecorderServer`
- Check the logs: `type "C:\ScreenRecorderServer\logs\service.log"`
- Try accessing: http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin instead

## Managing the Server

### Docker Management

```bash
# Start the server
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the server
docker-compose down

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f server

# Restart the server
docker-compose restart

# Check status
docker-compose ps
```

### Windows Service Management

```batch
# Start the server
sc start ScreenRecorderServer

# Stop the server
sc stop ScreenRecorderServer

# Check server status
sc query ScreenRecorderServer

# View server logs
type "C:\ScreenRecorderServer\logs\service.log"

# Uninstall the server
uninstall_server_service.bat
```

## Next Steps

Now that your server is running, you can:

1. Generate licenses for client computers
2. Monitor uploaded videos
3. Manage clients from the admin dashboard

See the [Client Installation Guide](CLIENT_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) for installing the client on computers you want to monitor.
